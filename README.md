# Fine-Tuned Vision Transformer for Face Classification  

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file)** for fine-tuning the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model on the **Haar Faces Dataset**.  
The model is trained to classify images into **real** and **fake** categories using `google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k`.  

## 📂 Files Included:
- `fine_tuning_vit.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluation  

## 🚀 How to Use the Notebook
1️⃣ Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.  
2️⃣ Run all cells to **load, fine-tune, and evaluate** the model.  
3️⃣ Modify the training parameters if needed.  

## 🔹 Dependencies
Ensure you have the following installed:  
```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers datasets
